# Research Lightning

This is a lightweight research framework designed to quickly implement and test deep learning algorithms in pytorch. This Readme describes the general structure of the framework and how to use each of its components. Here are some key features of the repository:
* Support for supervised learning algorithms
* Tensorboard logging
* Support for reinforcement learning algorithms
* Hardware stripping on both local machines and SLURM

I would suggest reading through all the documentation. If you use this package, please cite it appropriately as described in the [Usage](#Usage) section.

## Getting Started
The repository is split into multiple branches, each with a different purpose. Each branch contains implementations of standard algorithms and datasets. There are currently three main branches: main, image, and rl.
